Anamoly Detection in Forest Fire Systems

A Python-based anomaly detection system that monitors environmental sensors to identify potential forest fire conditions. This project uses machine learning to detect unusual patterns in temperature, humidity, and air quality data that may indicate fire hazards.

Key Features:

Multi-sensor anomaly detection using Isolation Forest algorithm
Visualization of environmental metrics with highlighted anomalies
Designed for early warning of forest fire conditions
Demo includes synthetic data generation for testing and validation

Technologies:

Python (NumPy, Pandas)

Scikit-learn for machine learning

Matplotlib for data visualization

Perfect for environmental monitoring applications, research projects, or as a starting point for more advanced forest fire detection systems.
